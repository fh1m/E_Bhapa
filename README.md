# E-Bhapa - Your E-companion

**Intro**
I am thrilled to present to you *E-Bhapa*,

*What can it do actually?*
**lets see**

**Feature 1: Follow Object**
E-Bhapa's first remarkable feature is its ability to intelligently follow objects detected by its sonar sensor. Using cutting-edge algorithms, E-Bhapa dynamically adjusts its speed to maintain a safe distance from the detected object, showcasing precise and responsive movement.

**Feature 2: Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance**
In the face of unexpected obstacles, E-Bhapa seamlessly navigates its surroundings with dynamic obstacle avoidance. When confronted with an obstacle, E-Bhapa strategically pauses before executing a randomized turn, ensuring smooth and efficient traversal through challenging environments.

**Feature 3: Enhanced Exploration**
Equipped with a diverse range of exploration tactics, E-Bhapa demonstrates unparalleled adaptability in unknown terrains. Through randomized actions including forward movement, backward movement, turns, and pauses, E-Bhapa explores its environment with a blend of curiosity and intelligence, uncovering new paths and opportunities.

**Feature 4: Proportional Speed Control**
E-Bhapa's proportional speed control ensures optimal performance in various environmental conditions. By adjusting its speed based on the complexity of its surroundings, E-Bhapa maximizes efficiency and safety, demonstrating unparalleled versatility in exploration tasks.

**Feature 5: Adaptive Speed Control**
E-Bhapa further elevates its capabilities with adaptive speed control, a groundbreaking feature that enables real-time adjustments to its velocity based on environmental complexity. By dynamically modulating its speed, E-Bhapa optimizes its performance, showcasing unmatched agility and intelligence in the field.
