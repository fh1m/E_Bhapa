## Code Summary

1. **setup() Function:**
   - This function is executed once at the beginning of the program.
   - It initializes serial communication for debugging and sets the pinMode for the ultrasonic sensor's TRIG_PIN and ECHO_PIN.

2. **loop() Function:**
   - The loop function runs continuously after the setup.
   - It retrieves the current distance from the ultrasonic sensor and prints it to the serial monitor for debugging.
   - Based on the distance measured, it determines the appropriate action for E-Bhapa to take: following an object, dynamically avoiding obstacles, or exploring the environment.

3. **measureDistance() Function:**
   - This function calculates the distance to an object detected by the ultrasonic sensor.
   - It sends a brief pulse to the sensor's TRIG_PIN to initiate a measurement and then measures the time it takes for the pulse to bounce back (echo) from the object.
   - The duration of the echo pulse is converted into distance using the formula: distance = (duration * speed of sound) / 2.

4. **adjustMotorSpeed() Function:**
   - This function adjusts the speed of E-Bhapa's motors to achieve the desired movement.
   - It takes two parameters: leftSpeed and rightSpeed, representing the speed of the left and right motors, respectively.
   - The function sets the speed of each motor using the setSpeed() method from the AFMotor library and then activates the motors to run in the FORWARD direction using the run() method.

5. **stopMotors() Function:**
   - This function stops all of E-Bhapa's motors.
   - It sets the speed of each motor to zero using the setSpeed() method and then releases the motors using the run() method with the RELEASE parameter.

6. **followObject() Function:**
   - This function enables E-Bhapa to track and follow objects within a specified distance range.
   - It adjusts the speed of the motors based on the distance to the detected object, ensuring E-Bhapa maintains a safe following distance while tracking the object's movement.

7. **dynamicObstacleAvoidance() Function:**
   - This function implements dynamic obstacle avoidance behavior for E-Bhapa.
   - It pauses E-Bhapa's movement, executes a randomized turn in a left or right direction to navigate around the obstacle, and then resumes exploration.

8. **enhancedExploration() Function:**
   - This function enhances E-Bhapa's exploration capabilities by executing a randomized sequence of actions, including moving forward, moving backward, turning left, turning right, and pausing.
   - It allows E-Bhapa to explore its environment comprehensively, uncovering new paths and opportunities for further exploration.

These functions work together seamlessly to provide E-Bhapa with intelligent and adaptive behavior, allowing it to navigate and explore its surroundings effectively in various scenarios.
